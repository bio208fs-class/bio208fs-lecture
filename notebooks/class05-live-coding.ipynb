    "\n",
    "The most ubiquitous file format used to represent nucleotide and protein sequence data is the FASTA format.  Wikipedia has a good [overview of the FASTA format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format).  We'll illustrate this format with an example -- the COVID-19 reference genome, which can be found on [Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) via [this link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512).\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of FASTA format:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Each file can hold one or more sequence records\n",
    " \n",
    " * The beginning of each record is delimited by a line called a header, which has a `>` character at the beginning, followed by the name associated with that record (and an optional description). For example `>seq1 Involved in...` would indicate the beginning of a record with the name `seq1` and the description \"Involved in...\".\n",
    " \n",
    " * On or more sequence lines follow header lines.  These lines are usually wrapped to have length <=80 characters but this is not required.\n",
